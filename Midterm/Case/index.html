			<h3>Palm Oil Industry in Indonesia</h3>
	
			Indonesia is 22nd place for labor rights violations, with most of its violations being connected to fundamental civil liberties and the right of workers to establish and join organizations. In Indonesia, most of the working poor are living at near poverty rates, rather than moderate or extreme poverty. Currently, indonesia is a lower middle-income status economy with high income inequality rates. As the world's top producer and exporter of palm oil, we dove deeper into the industry and discovered that for workers, the industry linked to the world's top beauty brands has a hidden dark side. The dark side features invisible women working on palm oil plantations. Only the fruits of their labor are visible, while their struggles remain invisible to the general public and they see no compensation for their work. Often, women work without pay to help their husbands meet otherwise <a href = https://apnews.com/article/palm-oil-abuse-investigation-cosmetics-2a209d60c42bf0e8fcc6f8ea6daa11c7 style="color:white">impossible daily quotas</a>.

			<h3><b>Burundi : A Complex Case of Extreme Poverty</b></h3>
			
			It is one of the poorest nations in the world. Burundi achieved independence from Belgium in 1962 and since then has struggled with an internal civil war between usually-dominant Tutsi minority and the Hutu majority. On the labor rights front, Burundi has received violations on protecting the right of workers to establish and join organizations, right to collective bargaining, and the right to strike. Despite 80% of the working population are employed in a high-value export-oriented agriculture industry, where they export gold ($90.5M), coffee ($43.9M) and tea ($23.3M) to some rich countries like the United Arab Emirates, so much of their people are still poor. One might suspect that this is another case of evil corporations exploiting poorer countries, but the socioeconomic context of extremely poor Burundi is more complex to solve by simply tightening labor rights. Most of Burundi's citizens are still farming for subsistence, there is still remnants of a civil war, and a great lack of economic diversification where the economy is fragile to external factors.
